# Marina Corona - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This is my second try at module 1.

My goals for this module are:
 * Comfort and ease with hashes
 * Understand how objects are instantiated and differences between instance variables, attrs and why we use each
 * Developing a workflow that consistently uses psuedocode at its start
 * More robust testing, not just testing for basic functionality but thinking creatively about edge cases
 * Creating more readable code
 * Refactoring consistently in my projects, specifically using the best method every time and splitting responsibilities evenly through classes
 * Building classes responsibly, each one having its own non-arbitrary role

### End of Module Assessment

* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Rails Basics: 3
* Javascript Basics: 3
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 3

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/Mastermindvol2
* [Original Assignment]https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

Evaluator: Mike

Notes: Program works.
Implemented difficulty levels.
There is a lot color.
There is a command line wrapper.
Some opportunities to refactor, use less instance variables, consider methods sending messages to each other.

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/binary_search_tree
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown

In this four day project I built a binary search tree that can insert, find depth, search, return depth based on score, find maximum and minimum, sort, load files and insert to tree, and find the health of the tree.

Evaluator: Horace

Notes:

* Clean and thorough implementation overall
* love the volume of tests
* Code is generally clean and well-organized at the small level
* Biggest area for improvement is continuing to strip down and
streamline the conceptual process at the high level
* Overall tests and implementation have some tendency to run around the
core of the idea -- reliance on extra ivars, nested methods, etc
* Keep thinking about what is the core idea of a process and how
to most clearly express that in code -- for a problem like this code should
read like an outline of what the actual algorithm is

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping ​*or*​ Recursion: 3

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/sorting_suite
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown

In this project, I built three separate programs that sort elements within an array. One was bubble sort, the second insertion sort and the last was merge sort.

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization (Version control maintains the code base): 4

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/Battleship
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown

In this project, I built a Battleship game where the player plays against the computer. z

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Test- Driven Development: 3
* REPL Interface: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Mid-Module Assessment

Evaluator: Nate

In this assessment, I added a method that found the highest scoring word within a Scrabble game.


* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 4
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Test- Driven Development: 4
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

#### Instructor Pairing

Instructor: Nate

In this pairing we worked on a CSV phone challenge that Mike had created the night before.

Notes:

- I'd like to see more planning before action.
  Bias towards action when you need more information,
  but spend more time consuming the spec and designing
  at a high level.
- Struggling with thinking through loop scope.
  Took several tries to get modified data out of the loop.
- Good at getting past walls. You don't get frustrated,
  or you're hiding it well.


## Team Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### HTTP: Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/HTTPYYKM
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

In this project, my partner Josh and I, built HTTP, a server that runs using Ruby.  The server included all iterations and one extension.
Which meant that the server could receive a request from a user, understand the request's intent and source, generate a response (like "Hello, World!(0)" or identifying if a word is valid) and then send the response to the user.

Evaluator: Tess

Notes:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test- Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of Friday, February 5th for Teach for America Summit.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

* I delivered 100% of the requested feedback
* 96% of those submissions were approved and delivered
* 84% of my submissions were meaningful to the recipient

#### For my peers:

* Toni Rib: The two times I’ve paired with Toni, I have been thoroughly impressed with her ability to look at someone else’s code, understand it and give clear and concise feedback.  With our Black Thursday project, she was able to draw out the overall project and help us with our understanding of the overall architecture.  Without giving us the answer, she gave us some great ideas on how to pair.  I’m incredibly impressed with her ability to give to the Turing community through tutoring, while managing her large projects and am very grateful to have her a part of our school.

* Joshua Washke: I feel very lucky to have gotten Josh as my partner for HTTP. Josh is very strong in both his ability to debug and think big picture about a project. From the beginning, he sketched out several options for the overall structure of the project.  He taught me how to use the architecture of a project to understand the overall purpose.  Besides his clear knowledge and comfort with Ruby, he is a great partner to work with.  He has a strong work ethic and was flexible when it came to divying projects.  I think Josh is a great asset to our cohort and am excited to work with him in the future.

* Kami Boers: Kami is a very strong problem solver. She has been great to work with for Black Thursday. I feel like I'm learning more about how classes call on each other through her explanations and understanding.  I also am very grateful to have her as a partner because she is very reliable and communicative. As a student advisory board member, her notes and presentations are very thorough.  I think Kami is a strong leader and think she will be such an asset to module 2.

#### From my peers:
* Patrick Hardy: It was great pairing with Marina. I feel like she was able to teach me several important workflow skills very quickly, and her experience is evident in her mastery of these skills. It's great that she immediately identified areas that I can improve in and helped me with that unprompted. Through this process she did realize there were some gaps in her memory of hot keys etc, which will improve with more practiced and/or keeping this information organized.

* Claudia Kiesenhofer: I really enjoyed working with you. I hadn't got that far in the exercise with the former partner as you had, so I needed a bit to catch up. I appreciated that you gave me the time for that and let me figure out things you already knew but also gave suggestions how to move on. We switched off with typing and figuring out the next steps even though you seemed to be way more familiar with the task list. Your way of communicating ideas and next step was very structured and clear which made it easy for me to follow you. Even though the timeframe for this pair work was very short and felt a bit rushed I learned a lot by suggesting and implementing solutions and also by implementing your suggestions. Thank you.

* Drew Thompson: We had good back and forth additions to the code.  Our understanding of different concepts led to better, more efficient code.
